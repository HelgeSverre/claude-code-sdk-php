# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-21

### Initial Release

This SDK is initially based off of the Official Claude Code SDK for Python, that I ironically made into PHP using
Claude Code. ðŸ¤–

Circle of life, I guess.

#### Interceptor System
- **Hook-based system** for tapping into Claude Code lifecycle events
  - `onQueryStart` - Fired when a query begins with prompt and options
  - `onRawMessage` - Fired when raw JSON is received from Claude Code CLI
  - `onMessageParsed` - Fired after a message is parsed into typed objects
  - `onQueryComplete` - Fired when query completes successfully
  - `onError` - Fired when errors occur with full error details

  - `FileLoggerInterceptor` - Log all events to files with timestamps
  - `MetricsInterceptor` - Track token usage, costs, and performance metrics
